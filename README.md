**eyepassgen** is a quick and easy password generator designed for Windows. Double clicking one of the generated passwords will prompt you on whether you want to set it to your clipboard or not. A few things to note:

- *Unique Characters* will make the application not generate a password with repeating letters. (Ex: No AuAf5 or fjhsDDh)
- *Unique Sequence* will make the application not generate a password with a similiar sequence (Ex: No ABC or 123)
